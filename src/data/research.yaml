introduction:
  - "My research focuses on the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Advertising. I am particularly interested in automatic ad text generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) and analyzing/understanding attractive advertising expressions."
  - "I also work on Data-to-Text tasks, which involve generating natural language text from numerical or structured data. I explore applications of language generation technologies to real-world challenges, such as generating weather forecast comments and stock market commentary."
