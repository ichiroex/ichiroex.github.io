introduction:
  - "My primary research interest lies in the creativity of Large Language Models (LLMs). I explore how LLMs can generate creative and attractive text across various domains, including ad text generation, summarization, and data-to-text applications."
  - "I also work on understanding what makes text attractive or appealing, particularly in advertising contexts, as well as computational approaches to humor understanding and generation."
